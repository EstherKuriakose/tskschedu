üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps (Frontend + Backend)
--------------------------------------------
1.To set up the **backend**, navigate to the `backend` folder, create a virtual environment using `python -m venv env`, and activate it (`source env/bin/activate` for Mac/Linux or `env\Scripts\activate` for Windows). Then install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Start the FastAPI server using `uvicorn main:app --reload`. The backend will now run at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. To set up the **frontend**, go to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to install all required packages. Once the installation is complete, use `npm start` to launch the React development server. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
